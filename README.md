# Urban Dictionary Search

Simple Google Chrome extension that grabs definitions from [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/). It is currently in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gfjijibnpohkjdmbahejpeoilmgjahei).

Since Urban Dictionary (currently) doesn't have an official API, the definitions are web scraped. For that reason the extension might break at any time (I doubt it will be soon, though, since UD is rarely updated). I probably won't update this extension anymore, so if it breaks feel free to fork away and fix it yourself.
